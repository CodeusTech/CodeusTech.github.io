## Shell Functions

The XCS shell provides quick and easy frontend access to several system modules.  When operating within the shell, it is not necessary to make *requests* to system functions.  Instead, you can call the service function directly, and the shell will make the request automatically.

Tether Modules that are automatically activated upon startup include:
* Firmware Drivers
* Network Sockets
