title: Foreign Function Interface
---

**Foreign Function Interfaces (FFI)** translate source code between XCSL and other functional programming languages.  FFI is one of the most core subsystems within XCS; even XCSL itself is defined within FFI.  

FFI is used to define syntax recognition for other programming languages (e.g. Haskell, Caml, LISP).  This module can also be used to build new languages/programs.
